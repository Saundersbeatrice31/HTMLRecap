    <h1>list of  5 Sucess Tips</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>1. Define your goals.</h2>
        <p>Write down your goal. Bring your goal to class with you each day. You'll want to remember your goal when things get tough and you hit those inevitable roadblocks.
        You'll get through it if you stay focused on the finish line!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>2. Mentally Prepare.</h2>
        <p>Come to class each day with the mindset that you're going to primarily "learn by doing." You'll write lines of code. Test it. The code won't work. You'll change it. It still won't work.
        You'll change it again. The code works! This is coding in a nutshell.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>3. Leave Your Ego at Door.</h2>
        <p>Full-immersion bootcamps are intense. It's very easy to get defensive and try to self-protect. The truth is that you aren't there to impress anyone. Be open to learning, and admit when you don't know something. 
        Ask questions. Learn to fail quickly so you can move on toward success!.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>4. Do Not Compare Yourself to Others.</h2>
        <p> It's important that you run your own race. Your coding career is going to be long and enjoyable. Programming is about persistence. Just keep moving forward. 
            It's about knowing and applying concepts and developing your personal coding confidence. It's not a race against your fellow students.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>5. Communicate.Ask alot of questions.</h2>
        <p> Don't be embarrassed to ask questions. Go for it! Sometimes the unasked question is the key to understanding a foundational concept. 
            Your question might be the same one that your fellow students are thinking about too.</p>
